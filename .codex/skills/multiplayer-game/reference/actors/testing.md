> Description: Rivet provides a straightforward testing framework to build reliable and maintainable applications. This guide covers how to write effective tests for your actor-based services.

## Setup

To set up testing with Rivet:

```bash
# Install Vitest
npm install -D vitest

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Basic Testing Setup

Rivet includes a test helper called `setupTest` that starts your registry in test mode and returns a client connected to it. This allows for fast, isolated tests without external dependencies.

## Testing Actor State

State persists within each test, allowing you to verify that your actor correctly maintains state between operations.

## Testing Events

For actors that emit events, you can verify events are correctly triggered by subscribing to them:

## Testing Schedules

Rivet's schedule functionality can be tested by scheduling work and waiting for it to run:

Use a short schedule and `expect.poll` the action's observable result. Vitest's fake date and fake JavaScript timers do not advance RivetKit's scheduler, which runs outside the test's JavaScript timer queue.

## Best Practices

1. **Isolate tests**: Each test should run independently, avoiding shared state.
2. **Test edge cases**: Verify how your actor handles invalid inputs, concurrent operations, and error conditions.
3. **Test scheduled operations**: Poll observable state or output with a bounded timeout instead of sleeping for an exact duration.
4. **Use realistic data**: Test with data that resembles production scenarios.

`setupTest` starts the registry and disposes the returned client when the test finishes, so you can focus on writing effective tests for your business logic.
