# Destroying Actors

> Source: `src/content/docs/actors/destroy.mdx`
> Canonical URL: https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/destroy
> Description: Actors can be permanently destroyed. Common use cases include:

---
- User account deletion
- Ending a user session
- Closing a room or game
- Cleaning up temporary resources
- GDPR/compliance data removal

Actors sleep when idle, so destruction is only needed to permanently remove data — not to save compute.

## Destroying An Actor

### Destroy via Action

To destroy an actor, use `c.destroy()` like this:

### Destroy via HTTP

Send a DELETE request to destroy an actor. This requires a token for authentication:

- **Rivet Cloud**: Use the service key (`sk_*`) from your `RIVET_ENDPOINT` URL. Find this in the dashboard under **Settings > Advanced > Backend Configuration** (e.g. the `sk_...` portion of `https://default:sk_abc123@api.rivet.dev`).
- **Self-hosted**: Use an admin token.

```typescript
const actorId = "your-actor-id";
const namespace = "default";
const token = "your-token";

await fetch(`https://api.rivet.dev/actors/${actorId}?namespace=${namespace}`, {
  method: "DELETE",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.rivet.dev/actors/{actorId}?namespace={namespace}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

To find the actor ID, you can list actors first:

```bash
curl "https://api.rivet.dev/actors?namespace={namespace}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Destroy via Dashboard

To destroy an actor via the dashboard, navigate to the actor and press the red "X" in the top right.

## Lifecycle Hook

Once destroyed, the `onDestroy` hook will be called. This can be used to clean up resources related to the actor. For example:

## Accessing Actor After Destroy

Once an actor is destroyed, any subsequent requests to it will fail with an `actor.not_found` error (`{ group: "actor", code: "not_found" }`). The actor's state is permanently deleted.

## API Reference

- [`ActorHandle`](/typedoc/types/rivetkit.client_mod.ActorHandle.html) - Has destroy methods
