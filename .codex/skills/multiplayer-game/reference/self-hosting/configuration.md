# Configuration

> Source: `src/content/docs/self-hosting/configuration.mdx`
> Canonical URL: https://rivet.dev/docs/self-hosting/configuration
> Description: Rivet Engine can be configured through environment variables or configuration files.

---
The full JSON Schema for the configuration is available at [/docs/engine-config-schema.json](/docs/engine-config-schema.json).

## Configuration Sources

Rivet supports JSON, JSON5, JSONC, YAML, YML, and environment variable configurations.

**Environment Variables**

Use the `RIVET__` prefix with `__` as separator to configure properties in the config. For example: set the `RIVET__postgres__url` environment variable for `postgres.url`.

**Configuration Paths**

Configuration files are automatically discovered in platform-specific directories:

- Linux: `/etc/rivet/config.json`
- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/rivet/config.json`
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\rivet\config.json`

**Multiple Files**

Multiple configuration files in the same directory are loaded and merged together. For example: `/etc/rivet/config.json` and `/etc/rivet/database.json` will be merged together.

**Override Configuration Path**

You can override the default configuration path using the `--config` flag:

```bash
# Load from a specific file
rivet-engine --config /path/to/config.json

# Load from a directory
rivet-engine --config /etc/rivet

# Load multiple paths (merged in order)
rivet-engine --config /etc/rivet/base.json --config /etc/rivet/override.json
```

## Configuration Reference

### Pegboard Envoy Load Balancing

`pegboard.envoy_load_balancer` supports the `hash` strategy for hash-ring-based envoy selection:

```json
{
	"pegboard": {
		"envoy_load_balancer": {
			"hash": {
				"virtual_nodes": 8,
				"samples": 2,
				"max_scan": 16,
				"use_snapshot_read": true
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Use `samples: 1` for a uniform random pick that skips slot reads. Use `samples >= 2` for power-of-K choices over envoy slot counts. Treat `virtual_nodes` as an operational invariant once envoys have registered.
