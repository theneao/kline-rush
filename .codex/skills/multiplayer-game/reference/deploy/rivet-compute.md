Using an AI coding agent? Open **Connect** on the [Rivet dashboard](https://dashboard.rivet.dev), select **Rivet Cloud**, and paste the one-shot prompt into your agent and have it connect with Rivet Compute for you.

## Steps

### Prerequisites

- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- A [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev) account and project
- Docker running locally

### Create a Dockerfile

Add a `Dockerfile` to your project root that builds and runs your RivetKit server:

```dockerfile @nocheck
FROM node:24-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "src/server.js"]
```

### Get Your Cloud Token

1. Open the [Rivet dashboard](https://dashboard.rivet.dev) and navigate to your project
2. Click **Connect** and select **Rivet Cloud**
3. Copy the **`RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN`** value shown

### Deploy

Run the deploy command from your project root. The token is saved to `~/.rivet/credentials`, so later deploys can omit it.

```bash
npx @rivetkit/cli deploy --token cloud_api_xxxxx
```

The CLI resolves your project from the token, builds and pushes your Docker image to Rivet's built-in registry, upserts the managed pool, and prints the deployment URL on stdout when the pool is ready.

### Optionally Add CI

After local deploys work, install the GitHub Actions workflow that deploys on every push and pull request:

```bash
npx @rivetkit/cli setup-ci
```

This writes `.github/workflows/rivet-deploy.yml`. Add your token as a repository secret to enable it:

```bash
gh secret set RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN
```

The workflow creates production and pull-request namespaces, posts preview links, and cleans up PR namespaces when pull requests close. See the [CLI reference](/docs/cli) for all commands.

### Monitor Deployment

The dashboard shows live status as Rivet Compute provisions your backend:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Initializing | Starting the runtime environment |
| Deploying | Pulling and launching your container |
| Binding | Connecting the runner to the network |
| Ready | Deployment complete |

Once the status reaches **Ready**, your backend is live and actors are available for connections.

If you are an agent monitoring the deployment via API rather than the dashboard, poll the managed-pool endpoint on the Cloud API.

The `RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN` secret is a `cloud_api_*` management token scoped to the Cloud API at `cloud-api.rivet.dev`. Use it for `Authorization: Bearer ...` against the Cloud API. Do not confuse it with a `pk_*` publishable key, which is scoped to the Rivet Engine API at `api.rivet.dev` and will 401 against this endpoint.

Substitute `$CLOUD_API_URL` (typically `https://cloud-api.rivet.dev`), `$PROJECT`, `$ORG`, `$CLOUD_NAMESPACE`, and `$CLOUD_TOKEN`.

Poll every 5 seconds until `status` is `ready`. Stop and investigate if `status` is `error`.

```bash
curl -s "$CLOUD_API_URL/projects/$PROJECT/namespaces/$CLOUD_NAMESPACE/managed-pools/default?org=$ORG" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUD_TOKEN"
```

## Checking Logs

Use the CLI to read your deployment's logs. By default `rivet logs` prints the last 100 lines from the `default` pool in the `production` namespace, oldest to newest, then exits. Pass `--pool` to read a different compute pool.

```bash
npx @rivetkit/cli logs
```

The CLI resolves your token the same way `deploy` does (the `--token` flag, then the `RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable, then `~/.rivet/credentials`).

### Follow logs live

Pass `--follow` (`-f`) to stream new logs as they arrive instead of fetching history:

```bash
npx @rivetkit/cli logs --follow
```

Each formatted line is printed as `<timestamp> [] <region> <message>`:

```
2026-06-16T18:26:51.160Z [INFO] eu-central-1 server listening on port 3000
2026-06-17T11:24:20.425Z [ERROR] us-east-1 failed to connect to upstream
```

A few examples:

```bash
# Last 200 lines from a specific namespace
npx @rivetkit/cli logs --namespace production -n 200

# Logs from a specific compute pool
npx @rivetkit/cli logs --pool my-pool

# Live tail, only lines containing "error"
npx @rivetkit/cli logs --follow --contains error

# JSON output piped to jq
npx @rivetkit/cli logs -n 50 --json | jq .
```

## Troubleshooting

If the status stays in **Initializing** for more than a few minutes, verify that:

- The `RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN` secret is correctly set in your GitHub repository
- The GitHub Actions workflow completed without errors — check the run logs

If the status shows **Error**, check that your container starts successfully and does not exit immediately (you can check this with container logs). Common causes:

- The server file is not calling `registry.start()`
- A runtime crash on startup — test the image locally with `docker run`
- The server is not listening on the `RIVET_PORT` environment variable (RivetKit reads `RIVET_PORT`, defaulting to `3000`)

## Pricing

You are billed for the compute resources your deployment uses while it is running.
