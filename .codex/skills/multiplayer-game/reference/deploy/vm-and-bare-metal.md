## Steps

### Prerequisites

- A Linux VM or bare metal server with SSH access
- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- Access to the [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev/) or a [self-hosted Rivet Engine](/docs/general/self-hosting)

### Upload Your App

- Build your RivetKit app locally
- Copy the build output to your server (example):

```bash
scp -r ./dist user@server:/opt/rivetkit-app
```

Place the files somewhere readable by the service user, such as `/opt/rivetkit-app`.

### Set Environment Variables

After creating your project on the Rivet dashboard, select VM & Bare Metal as your provider. You'll be provided `RIVET_ENDPOINT` and `RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` environment variables to use in the next step.

### Create the systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/rivetkit-app.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=RivetKit App
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/rivetkit-app
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server.js
Restart=on-failure
Environment=RIVET_ENDPOINT=<your-rivet-endpoint>
Environment=RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=<your-rivet-public-endpoint>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace the environment values with those from the Rivet dashboard and adjust paths to match your deployment.

### Start the Service

Reload systemd units and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now rivetkit-app.service
```

### Connect to Rivet

There is nothing to register in the dashboard. As a Runner, your app opens a connection out to Rivet on startup, so the host does not need a public URL or a URL pasted into a connect form. It only needs outbound network access to your Rivet endpoint.

Once the service is running, open the Rivet dashboard and confirm your app appears under **Runners**. It reconnects automatically if the connection drops.

## Operating

### Restart

Restart the service after deploying new builds or environment changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rivetkit-app.service
```

### Logs

Follow realtime logs when debugging:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u rivetkit-app.service -f
```
