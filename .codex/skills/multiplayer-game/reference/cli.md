> Description: Reference for the optional rivet CLI: deploy to Rivet Compute and run local dev for serverless platforms.

---
The `rivet` CLI (`@rivetkit/cli`) is optional. You only need it for:

| Use case | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Deploy to Rivet Compute | `rivet deploy` |
| Local dev for serverless platforms (Cloudflare, Supabase) | `rivet dev --provider <name>` |

Run it with your package runner:

```bash
npx @rivetkit/cli <command>
```

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `rivet dev` | Run a local engine and your handler's dev server. |
| `rivet deploy` | Build and deploy the project to Rivet Cloud. |
| `rivet pool` | List or delete compute pools in a namespace. |
| `rivet engine` | Run the bundled `rivet-engine` binary directly. |
| `rivet setup-ci` | Install the GitHub Actions deploy workflow. |
| `rivet token` | Mint a namespace-scoped token. |

## `rivet dev`

Starts a local engine, spawns your dev server, and registers the serverless runner pointing at it. The engine keeps running across restarts; Ctrl-C stops only the dev server.

```bash
rivet dev [--provider <serverless|cloudflare|supabase|none>] [--port N] [--fn-name NAME] [--url URL] [-- <command>...]
```

`--provider` selects how the dev server is launched. Anything after `--` is appended to the preset command (or is the command to run when no provider is set).

| `--provider` | Spawns | Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _(omitted)_ | your `-- <command>` (needs `--port`) | from `--port` |
| `serverless` | your `-- <command>` (gets `PORT`) | auto |
| `cloudflare` | `wrangler dev` | `8787` |
| `supabase` | `supabase functions serve` | `54321` |
| `none` | nothing (engine only) | — |

For `cloudflare`, the CLI also passes the engine endpoint as `--var RIVET_ENDPOINT:...`, so the Worker connects back with no `wrangler.toml` config.

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--port` | Handler port. Required without a provider unless `--url` is set. |
| `--fn-name` | Supabase function name (default `rivet`). |
| `--url` | Explicit handler URL, overriding port and path. |
| `--engine-binary` | Path to a `rivet-engine` binary. |

## `rivet deploy`

Builds and pushes your project's Docker image and upserts the managed pool, printing the dashboard URL. Deploys target the `default` pool unless you pass `--pool`; a new pool is created on first deploy. See [Deploying to Rivet Compute](/docs/deploy/rivet-compute).

```bash
rivet deploy --token cloud_api_xxxxx
```

The token is saved to `~/.rivet/credentials` (also read from `RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN`), so later deploys can omit it.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--token` | env / credentials | Rivet Cloud API token. |
| `--namespace` | `production` | Cloud namespace. |
| `--pool` | `default` | Compute pool to deploy to. |
| `--project` / `--org` | from token | Override project/org. |
| `--dockerfile` | `Dockerfile` | Dockerfile to build. |
| `--build-context` | `.` | Docker build context. |
| `--env KEY=VAL` | — | Environment override, repeatable. |
| `--image` | project slug | Image repository name. |
| `--tag` | git short SHA | Image tag. |

## `rivet pool`

Manages the compute pools in a namespace. A namespace can hold multiple pools; `default` is the one used when a `deploy` or `logs` command omits `--pool`.

### `rivet pool list`

```bash
rivet pool list
```

Each pool is printed as a status line (colorized by status) followed by its config (display name, image, resources, environment) and any error. Colors are disabled when stdout is not a terminal or `NO_COLOR` is set. This human-readable format is not stable; pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--token` | env / credentials | Rivet Cloud API token. |
| `--namespace` | `production` | Cloud namespace. |
| `--project` / `--org` | from token | Override project/org. |
| `--json` | — | Emit raw JSON instead of formatted output. |

### `rivet pool delete`

Tears down a compute pool, then waits until it is fully removed, printing status changes as it goes. Prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is passed, and refuses to run without confirmation when stdin is not a terminal.

```bash
rivet pool delete <name> --yes
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--namespace` | `production` | Cloud namespace the pool belongs to. |
| `--yes` | — | Skip the confirmation prompt. |
| `--token` | env / credentials | Rivet Cloud API token. |
| `--project` / `--org` | from token | Override project/org. |

## `rivet engine`

Runs the bundled `rivet-engine` binary directly, against the same local database and ports as `rivet dev`. Arguments are forwarded verbatim.

```bash
rivet engine nuke      # wipe local engine state
rivet engine wf list   # inspect workflows
```

## `rivet setup-ci`

Installs `.github/workflows/rivet-deploy.yml`, which deploys to Rivet Cloud on push and pull request. Add `--force` to overwrite. Then set the token secret:

```bash
gh secret set RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN
```

## `rivet token`

Mints a namespace-scoped token for connecting to Rivet. Only the token is printed to stdout, so it can be captured directly by scripts (e.g. `TOKEN=$(rivet token create --kind secret)`).

```bash
rivet token create --kind secret
```

| `--kind` | Prefix | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secret` | `sk_` | Server-side runner/runtime token. |
| `public` | `pk_` | Client token: resolve and manage actors. |
| `connection` | `ck_` | Client token limited to resolving actors and opening connections. |

By default the namespace must already exist. Pass `--create-namespace` to create it first (useful for per-branch CI namespaces).

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--kind` | _(required)_ | Token kind: `secret`, `public`, or `connection`. |
| `--namespace` | `production` | Cloud namespace. |
| `--create-namespace` | — | Create the namespace if it does not exist. |
| `--token` | env / credentials | Rivet Cloud API token. |
| `--project` / `--org` | from token | Override project/org. |

## Engine binary resolution

`rivet dev` and `rivet engine` resolve the `rivet-engine` binary from, in order: `--engine-binary`, `RIVET_ENGINE_BINARY_PATH`, a binary bundled next to the CLI, a local `target/{debug,release}` build, then an auto-downloaded release. Set `RIVETKIT_ENGINE_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=0` to require a local binary.
